Define the Problem

# Why define problem?(If you do NOT define the problem)
  - Just wandering around in the data
  - May not find anything
  - get gigantie analytical report, but cannot give any recommendation/solve problem

# How to define problem?
  - Find your client to define your problem
  - Know your client as well as you can so that you can help your client

# Who are clients?
- BOSS
- Company CEO
- Even yourself

# Client types: 
There can be multiple clients types, so you need spend more time on knowing your clients
- well or badly informed about his data
- well or badly informed about his problems or goals
- well or badly ifnromed about his business
- focused or indecisive
- clear or vague
- intutive or analytic

# Ask question skill
- Always ask "how much". Make your goals and beliefs quantitative.
- Anticipate what your client thinks about.
- Find something curious in the numbers.

# Extension:
{note}
1. Goal/Information can be vague
  Infomation from client can be vague, you need to ask/know more from your client
2. Don't need SPECIFIC goal before look data
  - You don't need to have a problem in mind just to look at data. 
  - But keep in mind that looking by itself is not yet data analysis. 
  - Data analysis is all about _**identifying problems**_ and then _**solving problems**_.
3. Data analysts need help clients think trough their problem
{note}

{info}
- Even exploratory data analysis needs goals!
- Do need pay attention/time on define problems carefully!

{danger}
1. Do not give **million pages long** report, long-long report means:
- analysis won't focus enough on problem
- will **pelt client with information** as a way of ducking data analyst's obligation to **solve a problem** and **recommend a decision**.
